## ⚙️ Setup
To set up the environment for Q2F-Phys, please execute the following script:
```bash
bash setup.sh
```
This will automatically create a dedicated conda environment and install all necessary dependencies. The setup script has been tested and verified on Linux systems. If you are using Windows or macOS, manual installation of dependencies may be required.



## 📁 Datasets
To use Q2F-Phys, it is necessary to prepare appropriate benchmark datasets. Please refer to the following publications for details on each dataset.

## 🖥️ Testing with Pre-trained Models
Please refer to the configuration files located in `./configs/infer_configs`.

### Intra-Dataset Evaluation (Example)
To run the pre-trained model for **intra-dataset** evaluation (i.e., training and testing on the same dataset), you can use the following example:

- **MMPD → MMPD**:
```bash
python main.py --config_file ./configs/infer_configs/MMPD_MMPD_Q2FPhys.yaml
```

### Cross-Dataset Evaluation (Examples)
To run the pre-trained model for **cross-dataset** evaluation (i.e., training and testing on different datasets), you can refer to the following examples:

- **PURE → UBFC**:
```bash
python main.py --config_file ./configs/infer_configs/PURE_UBFC_Q2FPhys.yaml
```

- **UBFC → PURE**:
```bash
python main.py --config_file ./configs/infer_configs/UBFC_PURE_Q2FPhys.yaml
```



## 🧮 Computing Model Complexity
To calculate the model's number of parameters, multiply–accumulate operations (MACs), and throughput:
```
python model_Para_MACs_Thro.py
```
